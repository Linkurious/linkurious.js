## General
This plugin enables the activation and deactivation of nodes and edges by clicking on them. The clicked nodes or edges which are already active are deactivated. Multiple nodes or edges may be deactivated by holding the Ctrl or Meta key while clicking on them. Both nodes and edges cannot be active at the same time.

See the following [example code](../../examples/plugin-select.html) for full usage.

To use, include all .js files under this folder. Then initialize it as follows:

````javascript
var activeState = sigma.plugins.activeState(sigInst);
var select = sigma.plugins.select(sigInst, activeState);
````

Optionnaly bind keyboard events as follows:

````javascript
var kbd = sigma.plugins.keyboard(sigInst, sigInst.renderers[0]);
select.bindKeyboard(kbd);
````

The plugin will be killed when Sigma is killed. Kill the plugin instance manually as follows:

````javascript
sigma.plugins.killSelect();
````

- <kbd>spacebar</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd>: select isolated nodes (i.e. of degree 0)
- <kbd>spacebar</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd>: select leaf nodes (i.e. nodes with 1 adjacent node)
